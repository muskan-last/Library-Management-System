### 🚀 Features

* 📘 Add new books to the library
* 🗂️ Display all available books
* 🔍 Search books by ID, title, or author
* 👥 Manage student/member records
* 🔄 Issue and return books
* 💾 Data storage using file handling in C++

---

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Language:** C++
* **Compiler:** GCC / MinGW / Turbo C++ *(customize as per your setup)*
* **IDE (Optional):** Code::Blocks / Visual Studio Code / Dev-C++

---

### ⚙️ How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/library-management-system.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**

   ```bash

   ```

3. **Compile the code:**

   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o library
   ```

4. **Run the program:**
